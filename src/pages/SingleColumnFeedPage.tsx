I\u2019m not trying to create paranoia, but if you\u2019re seeing several of these signals at once, it might be a good moment to quietly update your resume.\n\nLayoffs rarely happen overnight; they\u2019re usually the result of months of decisions and signals. Looking back, the signs were often there: hiring freezes, sudden budget scrutiny, leadership becoming vague about roadmap priorities.\n\nIf multiple signals start appearing at the same time, it\u2019s usually not random. It\u2019s a signal that the company may already be preparing for changes behind the scenes.\n\nThe first thing I always noticed was a shift in tone during all-hands meetings. Leaders would start using phrases like \u201coperational efficiency\u201d and \u201cstrategic realignment.\u201d Projects that were top priority last quarter would quietly disappear from the roadmap.",
